# Bioinformatics_journey
**ICIPE_BIOINFORMATICS_INTERNSHIP**
***

 Hello and welcome, 
 
 My name is Samuel Mwasya, currently I am currently undertaking a four-months bioinformatics internship at International Centre for Insects' Physiology and Ecology *(icipe)*.
 
 I am on a journey of becoming a Bioinformatician.
 
***
 
## Career Vision

To become a Bioinformatician skilled in  developing mathematical models and innovativation in biology based technology and computation.

### Vision to be achieved during the Internship

Understand how to develop mathematical models to augment human reasoning and accelerate scientific discoveries.

To understand different approaches to biological dataset and redesigning datatypes depending on their area of conern and needs using appropriate tools.



***
## Mission
To understand various statistical software and technical skills required to become a higher level expertise in the field of  bioinformatics as well as developing mathematical models. 

To use my passion for research and statistics into the field of bioinformatics.
To understand clearly how my strengths in mathematics and statistics will of the best fit in bioinformatics.

## why bioinformatics?

The reasons for having interest to become a bioinformatician

When I joined college I wanted to pursue any course leading me to numbers only, and for that reason I ended up choosing BSc Mathematics which was combined with more than ten courses of biological studies in the first two years of college.
I developed interest  with computation of data thus  automatically leading me to Statistics in my 3rd year in college. 
This exposed me to studying coding in R and other programming language like Python and C++ in order to analyze data.  

I later developed interest in bioinformatics when I collaborated with my University supervisor in analyzing data in several project from KEMRI welcome Trust that he had partnered with. I wanted to understand the whole thing about the project however it was limited to my level of study at that time.



Since then, I have always been in the search to finding a way forward to learn and understand deep torwards bioinformatics.
To me I'm curious to understand and explore on how to participate in the field of biology to use my strengths in mathematical/statistical background in order to contribute to innovation in biology based technology and computation.



## Why bioinformatics internship?

I would like to understand how to use my mathematical/statistical strengths and skills in developing models and data management to enhance human reasoning and accelerate scientific discoveries alongside clearly understanding which field of bioinformatics I am best to explore and grow with my mathematical background. 

I have a goal of getting to understand clearly how best I can apply my mathematical/ statistical strengths in bioinformatics.
